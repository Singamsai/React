      <p>At Zappos.com, our purpose is simple: to live and deliver WOW.<br/><br/>
        Twenty year ago, we began as a small online retailer that only sold shoes. Today, we still sell shoes--as well as<br></br> clothing, handbags, accessories, and more. That  "more" is providing the very best customer service, 
        customer <br/>experience. and company culture.  We aim to inspire the world by showing it's possible to simultaneously deliver <br/>happiness to customers, employees, vendors, shareholders, and the community in a long-term, sustainable way. <br/>
        <br></br>We hope that in the future people won't even realize we started selling shoes online. Insted, they'll know Zappos as a <br/>service company that just happens to sell______.
